# Ukraine Weekly Aid
Hi! My name is Ihor Hadzera. I'm a software engineer and Ukrainian. As all of probably know, at 2022 Feb 24 Russia started invasion in the independent state of Ukraine. Ukrainian state and people desperatly need world's support against Russia's unprovoked and unjustified attack. Many people are willing to help, but struggle to find appropiate fundation/fundraiser based on their beliefs. I created this repository to share a weekly set of links to fundraisers that I found valuable and trustworthy grouped by categories. I hope that you'll like it!

# Contributing

- all links should be attached description at least in English. As more comprehensive description as better
